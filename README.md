A PowerShell utility module providing quick access to common **Windows Run dialog** commands.  
Useful for quick reference, training, automation, or everyday efficiency.

## 📦 Module Overview

This module provides a single cmdlet:

- `Get-UtilWinRunCommands`: Returns a list of useful commands that can be executed from the **Windows Run (`Win + R`)** dialog. Examples include `cmd`, `regedit`, `msconfig`, and more.

## 🚀 Usage

First, clone the repository (you can change the path if you use a different folder):

```

Make sure the path is included in your PowerShell module search path:

To make this change permanent, add that line to your PowerShell profile:
